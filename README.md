    git clone https://github.com/JaydipDabhi/milk-admin.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

    ```
    cd milk-admin
    ```

3. **Install PHP dependencies**:
   This project uses Composer to manage PHP dependencies. To install them, run the following command:

    ```
    composer install
    ```

4. **Copy .env.example to .env**:
   The .env file contains environment-specific variables (such as your database configuration). Copy the contents of .env.example to a new .env file:

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Require Intervention Image 2.7 via Composer**:
   Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

6. **Includes Intervention Image with storage**:
   If your project includes file uploads or image handling with `Intervention Image`, you should include:

   Laravel requires an application key for encryption and other security purposes. Generate the application key by running:

    ```
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

8. **Run database migrations**:
   Laravel includes migrations to create the required database tables. Run the following command to set up the database schema:

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

9. **Run the Laravel development server**:
   Start Laravel‚Äôs built-in development server by running:

    ```
